## üî® Implementation Task

**Created by:** Tickets Manager Agent
**From Spec:** #[spec issue number]
**Status:** üîç Needs Engineering Manager Review

## Problem Statement
<!-- From product spec - the WHY -->



## Product Spec Reference
**Original Spec:** #[issue number]
**Related Issues:** #[issue], #[issue]

## Requirements
<!-- From product spec -->

- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Clear, testable criteria from spec -->

- [ ] AC 1 (clear, testable)
- [ ] AC 2 (measurable)
- [ ] AC 3 (observable)

## Technical Implementation Notes
<!-- High-level technical approach - will be detailed by Engineering Manager -->

- Use Neo4j for [specific purpose]
- Generate embeddings for [specific data]
- Log [specific events/metrics]

## Success Metrics
<!-- How to measure -->

- Metric 1: [how to measure]
- Metric 2: [target value]

## Test Plan
<!-- Testing requirements -->

- [ ] Unit tests for [component]
- [ ] Integration tests for [workflow]
- [ ] CLI test with [scenario]

## Edge Cases
<!-- From spec -->

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Edge case 1 | |
| Edge case 2 | |

## Dependencies

## üîç Engineering Manager Review

<!-- EM adds technical details below -->

### Technical Approach
<!-- Validated/Modified approach with reasoning -->



### Architecture Decisions
- **Decision 1:**
- **Decision 2:**

### Data Model Changes
<!-- Schema changes needed in Neo4j, if any -->

```cypher
-- Example schema changes
```

### Interfaces & Contracts

```typescript
// Required interfaces
interface ComponentName {
  method(): ReturnType;
}
```

### Logging Requirements

```typescript
// Example structured logs required
logger.info('event_name', {
  field1: value,
  field2: value
});
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Error case 1: [scenario] ‚Üí [handling strategy]
- Error case 2: [scenario] ‚Üí [handling strategy]

### Performance Considerations
- Expected latency: [target]
- Query optimization: [approach]
- Caching strategy: [if needed]

### Testing Requirements

```typescript
// Required test scenarios
describe('Component', () => {
  it('should test scenario 1');
  it('should test scenario 2');
});
```

### Technical Risks
- Risk 1: [description] ‚Üí [mitigation]

### Estimated Complexity
- **Complexity:** Low/Medium/High
- **Estimated Time:** [hours/days]
- **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
