# 🤖 Automated Coding Workflow Enabled

Your Present-Agent2 project now has an automated subagent workflow configured!

```

### ✅ Capabilities Enabled

1. **Automatic Context Loading**
   - Hook detects coding requests (build, create, implement, etc.)
   - Reminds Claude about project architecture and standards
   - No need to repeat project details

2. **Architect Agent**
   - Specialized for this project's graph-based architecture
   - Enforces TypeScript, logging, and testing standards
   - Follows product vision priorities
   - Uses TodoWrite to track progress

3. **Project Context**
   - Quick reference to data model, architecture decisions
   - Current development status
   - What to build vs. what to defer

## How to Use

### Simple Method (Recommended)
Just ask for what you need naturally:

```
Build the recommendation engine with Neo4j graph traversal and vector embeddings
```

The hook will automatically provide context, and I'll follow the architect guidelines.

### Explicit Agent Method
For complex multi-step tasks, you can explicitly invoke the agent:

```
Use the architect agent to build the complete data ingestion pipeline
```

### Benefits You'll See

✅ **Consistent code quality** - TypeScript, error handling, logging standards
✅ **Better architecture** - Graph-first design, proper data modeling
✅ **Automatic progress tracking** - Todos managed automatically
✅ **Less repetition** - Context remembered across requests
✅ **Focus** - Only builds what's in product vision

## Current Development Status

See your active todos:
1. ✏️ Design Neo4j graph schema (in progress)
2. ⏳ Build data ingestion pipeline
3. ⏳ Generate vector embeddings
4. ⏳ Build recommendation engine
5. ⏳ Create CLI testing program

## Next Steps

You're ready to build! Just tell me what you want to work on:

- "Continue with the Neo4j schema design"
- "Build the complete recommendation engine"
- "Set up the data ingestion pipeline"
- Or anything else...

The automation will handle the rest with proper context and standards! 🚀
