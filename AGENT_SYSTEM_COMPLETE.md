### 🔄 Workflow System

Complete agent orchestration from idea to validated implementation:

```
Product Manager → Tickets Manager → Engineering Manager
    → Coding Agent → Testing Agent → User Simulation → ✅
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Full Workflow (Recommended)
```
Build the recommendation engine using the full agent workflow
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Research and create feature spec (Product Manager)
2. Create GitHub issues (Tickets Manager)
3. Review and enhance technically (Engineering Manager)
4. Implement with quality standards (Coding Agent)
5. Test and verify (Testing Agent)
6. Validate with personas (User Simulation Agent)

### Option 2: Single Agent
```
Use the architect agent to build the data ingestion pipeline
```

### Option 3: Chain Specific Agents
```
Use product-manager to spec out recommendations, then tickets-manager
to create issues, then engineering-manager to review
```

## 💡 Example Commands

### Start a New Feature
```
Use the product-manager agent to research and create a specification
for the core recommendation engine, considering the product assumptions
in product_vision.md
```

### Implement from Spec
```
Use the engineering-manager agent to review the spec, then have the
architect agent implement it with full logging and tests
```

### Test Everything
```
Use the testing-agent to run all tests, then use the user-simulator
agent to validate with personas: Sarah, Mike, and Lisa
```

### Debug an Issue
```
Use the testing-agent to investigate why recommendations are slow
and provide a detailed analysis with logs
```

## 🎯 What This Enables

### 🏆 Quality
- **Consistent architecture** - Engineering Manager enforces patterns
- **Complete specs** - Product Manager ensures clear requirements
- **Thorough testing** - Testing Agent catches bugs before users
- **UX validation** - User Simulator ensures real-world usability

### ⚡ Speed
- **Less context repetition** - Agents remember project details
- **Automated handoffs** - Smooth transitions between phases
- **Parallel work** - Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- **Rapid iteration** - Quick feedback loops

### 📊 Measurability
- **Success metrics tracked** - User Simulator measures everything
- **Product assumptions validated** - Test hypotheses systematically
- **Clear acceptance criteria** - Know when features are "done"
- **Observable system** - Extensive logging throughout

|-------|--------------|
| Product Manager | Clear requirements + success metrics |
| Tickets Manager | Complete issues + dependencies |
| Engineering Manager | Technical approach validated |
| Coding Agent | Code + tests + logging |
| Testing Agent | All tests passing + no bugs |
| User Simulation | UX validated + metrics measured |

## 🚀 Next Steps

You're ready to build! Here are some great starting points:

### 1. Define the Recommendation Engine
```
Use the product-manager agent to research and create a detailed
specification for the core recommendation engine, including:
- Graph traversal strategy
- Vector embedding approach
- Scoring algorithm
- Success metrics
```

### 2. Review Your Product Data
```
Use the product-manager agent to analyze the 41,686 products and
105,731 facets in data/export/ and propose how to best leverage
this data for recommendations
```

### 3. Build the Foundation
```
Use the full agent workflow to build:
1. Neo4j graph schema
2. Data ingestion pipeline
3. Vector embedding generation
4. CLI testing interface
```

### 4. Test and Iterate
```
Use the user-simulator agent to test recommendations with all
personas and identify areas for improvement
```

## 💪 What Makes This Powerful

### Traditional Development
```
You: "Build a recommendation engine"
Claude: [Writes code, might miss requirements, inconsistent quality]
```

### With Agent System
```
You: "Build a recommendation engine using the full agent workflow"

Product Manager: [Researches, creates detailed spec with metrics]
Tickets Manager: [Breaks into 8 organized GitHub issues]
Engineering Manager: [Reviews architecture, adds technical guidance]
Coding Agent: [Implements with logging, tests, error handling]
Testing Agent: [Verifies quality, finds edge case bugs, reports]
Coding Agent: [Fixes bugs]
Testing Agent: [Verifies fixes]
User Simulation: [Tests with 5 personas, measures metrics, validates UX]

Result: Production-quality feature with validated assumptions ✅
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your multi-agent development system is fully configured and ready to use.

**Try it now:**
```
Use the product-manager agent to review product_vision.md and
propose the first feature we should build
```

Or jump right into implementation:
```
Build the recommendation engine using the full agent workflow
```

The agents will handle everything with quality, consistency, and measurable results! 🚀

**Questions?** Just ask:
- "How does the agent workflow work?"
- "Which agent should I use for [task]?"
- "Show me an example of [agent] in action"

**Ready to build something amazing!** 💪✨
