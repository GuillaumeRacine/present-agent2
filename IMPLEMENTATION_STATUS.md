## üöÄ How to Continue

**When picking up this project:**

1. Read this file (IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
2. Review `src/services/orchestrator.ts` to understand the flow
3. Check `src/types/agents.ts` for all type definitions
4. Start with completing Explorer agent (most critical)
5. Test with CLI interface once Explorer is done
6. Iterate on other agents based on test results

**File Reference:**
- Architecture: `GRAPH_SCHEMA_V2.md`, `SYSTEM_COHERENCE_REVIEW.md`
- Agent specs: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Implementation: `src/services/agents/*.ts`
- Types: `src/types/agents.ts`

---

**Status Summary:** Core infrastructure complete. Agent workflow fully functional with context passing. 6/10 agents fully implemented, 3/10 partially implemented. Explorer agent (product discovery) is the most critical next step.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 4-6 hours of focused implementation
- 2 hours: Complete Explorer agent
- 1 hour: Complete Memory agent
- 1 hour: Schema setup and CLI
- 1-2 hours: Testing and debugging
